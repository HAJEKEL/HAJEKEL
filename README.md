### Hello Amigos 👋

### Hi Folks 👋

Hi, I'm Henk Jekel 👋
I'm a robotics engineer with a passion for deep learning and computer vision. I recently reproduced the paper EfficientNetV2: Smaller Models and Faster Training and have shared my code in a GitHub repository. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies, and I'm excited about the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the field of robotics.

🔭 What I'm working on
Reproducing other cutting-edge deep learning papers and experimenting with new architectures and techniques
Building projects that integrate computer vision and robotics, such as object recognition and autonomous navigation
Developing my skills in software engineering and agile methodologies to build reliable and scalable systems
🌱 What I'm currently learning
Reinforcement learning and how it can be applied to robotics
Advanced computer vision techniques such as multi-object tracking and 3D reconstruction
Cloud computing and distributed systems for scalable machine learning
